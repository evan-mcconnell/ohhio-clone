# _Clone of Ohhio website homepage_

#### _This clonesite preserves much of the styles of the original site, though lacks in functionality beyond responsive media queries._

#### By _**Kimberly McConnell**_

## Description

_This styling project makes use of SASS for styling, including use of mixins, variables, and nested styles. Groups of similar items are organized using flexboxes. Responsive design is built into the styles using flexboxes and vw/vh prefixed when possible, and media queries are used to scale and reorganize in other cases (ie. in the header)._
